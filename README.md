# Lighthouse Manager

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ekw2gnwcdhjaphjh?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/BenWoodford/lighthousemanager)

Lighthouse Manager is a quick and easy way to save/restore your Lighthouse and Chaperone configs. We recommend using it from a shared network drive or USB stick so that you can very quickly open it, restore your room setup and move on to the next PC.

## Usage

It's so ridiculously easy to use, just run the EXE and the rest is self explanatory 

## Coming Soon

- Command Line args for event quicker, non-interactive deployment
